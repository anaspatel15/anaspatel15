- 👋 Hi, I’m @anaspatel15
- 👀 I’m interested in UI/UX Designing.
- 🖌️ I prefer working on the design aspect of the interfaces rather than the coding/implementing aspect.
- 🌱 I have recently graduated with a BSc (Hons) in Computer Science at Heriot Watt University, Dubai, UAE.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve designing UIs for apps and websites.
- 📫 How to reach me - anasp4321@gmail.com!!
